      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I'm pursuing my MBA at Tarleton State University with a background in Computer Science. 
        My journey began with a strong interest in video games and technology, 
        which has led me to develop skills in full-stack web development, database systems, and 
        software engineering.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering 
        and a minor in Mathematics, and I’m now expanding my expertise through my MBA to 
        bridge the gap between technical skills and business strategy.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Currently, I’m looking for opportunities where I can combine my technical 
        expertise and analytical mindset to build impactful solutions — whether 
        that’s in software development, data analysis, or product design. I enjoy 
        working on projects that challenge me, and I thrive in collaborative 
        environments where I can contribute to team success.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        I'm a retired collegiate athlete that competed in Cross Country & Track and Field at 
        the Division I & Division II levels. Currently, I still enjoy running, fitness, and 
        continuous self-improvement. I believe the same discipline and persistence acquired 
        over my 5 years of collegiate competition apply to building software and achieving 
        long-term goals.
